## Problem Statement

Views are virtual tables in SQL Server that simplify complex queries and provide customized representations of data.

This exercise demonstrates the creation of views using:

- Table Joins
- Computed Columns
- Salary Calculations
- Employee Reporting

---

## Objectives

- Create SQL Server Views
- Perform joins within views
- Use computed columns
- Generate employee reports using views

---

## Database Schema

### Tables Used

- Departments
- Employees

### Relationships

- One Department can have multiple Employees
- Each Employee belongs to one Department

---

## Exercises Implemented

### Exercise 1 - Simple View

View Created:

```sql
vw_EmployeeBasicInfo
```

Purpose:

- Display employee details
- Join Employees and Departments tables
- Show department information along with employee records

---

### Exercise 2 - Computed Column - Full Name

View Created:

```sql
vw_EmployeeFullName
```

Computed Column:

```sql
FirstName + ' ' + LastName AS FullName
```

Purpose:

- Generate employee full names
- Demonstrate computed columns in views

---

### Exercise 3 - Computed Column - Annual Salary

View Created:

```sql
vw_EmployeeAnnualSalary
```

Computed Column:

```sql
Salary * 12 AS AnnualSalary
```

Purpose:

- Calculate annual employee salary
- Perform arithmetic calculations within views

---

### Exercise 4 - Employee Report View

View Created:

```sql
vw_EmployeeReport
```

Computed Columns:

```sql
FullName
AnnualSalary
Bonus
```

Bonus Calculation:

```sql
(Salary * 12) * 0.10 AS Bonus
```

Purpose:

- Generate employee reports
- Combine multiple computed columns
- Provide salary and bonus information

---
