**Name:** Nirnay Ghosh

**Objective**  
Configure EF Core's `DbContext` to connect C# models to a SQL Server database.

`DbContext` represents a session with the database, used to query and save data. It contains `DbSet` properties that map to tables.

**Steps Performed**
- Created an `AppDbContext` class  
- Registered `Products` and `Categories` as `DbSet`s  
- Configured SQL Server connection string using `UseSqlServer()`  
- Verified context creation in the console
