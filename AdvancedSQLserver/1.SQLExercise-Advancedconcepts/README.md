# SQL Exercise - Advanced Concepts

## Developer Info
- **Name**: Nirnay Ghosh
- **Assignment**: Cognizant Digital Nurture 5.0
- **Skill**: Advanced SQL Server Concepts

---

## Problem Statement

This exercise demonstrates the implementation of various advanced SQL Server concepts used in real-world database systems, including:

- Ranking Functions
- GROUPING SETS
- ROLLUP
- CUBE
- Recursive Common Table Expressions (CTE)
- PIVOT Operations
- Common Table Expressions (CTE)

---

## Objectives

- Implement SQL Server ranking functions
- Perform multidimensional aggregation using GROUPING SETS, ROLLUP, and CUBE
- Generate recursive data using Recursive CTE
- Transform rows into columns using PIVOT
- Use CTEs for modular and readable query design

---

## Database Schema

The following tables were created for the exercises:

### Tables Used

- **Products**
- **Customers**
- **Orders**
- **OrderDetails**

### Relationships

- One Customer can place many Orders
- One Order can contain many Products
- OrderDetails acts as a junction table between Orders and Products

---

## Exercises Implemented

### Exercise 1 - Ranking Functions

Implemented:

- `ROW_NUMBER()`
- `RANK()`
- `DENSE_RANK()`

Purpose:
- Assign sequential row numbers
- Handle ties using ranking functions
- Compare ranking behavior within product categories

---

### Exercise 2A - GROUPING SETS

Purpose:
- Generate multiple aggregation levels in a single query
- Summarize sales by:
  - Region
  - Category
  - Region and Category

---

### Exercise 2B - ROLLUP

Purpose:
- Produce hierarchical subtotals
- Generate grand totals automatically

---

### Exercise 2C - CUBE

Purpose:
- Generate all possible aggregation combinations
- Perform multidimensional analysis

---

### Exercise 3 - Recursive CTE

Purpose:
- Generate calendar dates recursively
- Demonstrate self-referencing query structures

---

### Exercise 4 - PIVOT

Purpose:
- Convert row-based sales data into column-based format
- Generate month-wise sales reports

---

### Exercise 5 - Common Table Expression (CTE)

Purpose:
- Calculate order counts for customers
- Identify customers having more than one order

---
